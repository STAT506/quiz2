### 1. Write out the mathematical notation for standard linear regression model and note the three components of GLMs.

### 2. Consider a linear regression model with one continuous variable and one categorical variable with three levels (such as high, medium, low) with an interaction term.

#### a. Write out the mathematical notation for this model and clearly articulate the interpretation for all of the parameters. You can assume the continuous variable has been centered.

#### b. Create a figure of the fitted model and use annotation (`annotate`) to show how the model parameters create the slope and intercepts.
